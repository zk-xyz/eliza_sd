I'll help you set up a new Eliza chatbot deployment for your Sober Dad site based on the ElizaOS framework. Let's approach this systematically, drawing from our previous experience with the zkxyz project while focusing specifically on Eliza's requirements.
Deployment Strategy Overview
From the documents provided, I can see you're trying to create an Eliza agent deployment on Render, with the goal of embedding it via iframe into your Sober Dad site. This is similar to your previous zkxyz project but with Eliza's specific architecture.
1. Project Structure Setup
Eliza has a two-part architecture:

Agent service (backend)
Client service (frontend)

We'll need to configure both for Render deployment.
2. Render Configuration
Let's establish the correct configuration for both services:
Agent Service (eliza-agent)
CopyEnvironment Variables:
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=10000
HOST=0.0.0.0
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here
SERVICE_TYPE=agent
Client Service (eliza-client)
CopyEnvironment Variables:
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=10000
HOST=0.0.0.0
SERVICE_TYPE=client
VITE_SERVER_URL=https://your-agent-service-url.onrender.com
3. Docker Entry Point
Both services will use the same Dockerfile but different execution paths based on the SERVICE_TYPE variable:
bashCopy#!/bin/sh

if [ "$SERVICE_TYPE" = "client" ]; then
    echo "Starting client service in $NODE_ENV mode..."
    cd client
    pnpm run build
    exec pnpm exec vite preview --host "0.0.0.0" --port 10000 --strictPort true
else
    echo "Starting agent service..."
    exec pnpm start --character=characters/claude_agent.character.json
fi
4. Vite Config for Production
We need to ensure your Vite config is properly set for production:
javascriptCopypreview: {
    host: '0.0.0.0',
    port: 10000,
    strictPort: true
},
optimizeDeps: {
    include: ['react', 'react-dom']
}
5. Character Configuration
For your Sober Dad site, we'll want to customize the Claude character file to align with your content focus.
Implementation Steps
Let's go through the specific steps to get this deployed:

Fork the ElizaOS repository to your new eliza_sd project
Configure the character file for the Sober Dad context
Set up the Docker configuration
Configure Render for both services
Set up the iframe integration

Would you like me to help with any specific part of this implementation first? For example, I can help customize the character file for your Sober Dad context, or focus on the Render deployment configuration.
